## 🧙‍♂️ Lore

Step into the mystical world of WildRogue.  Jeff the sock salesman?  what is that all about?  Janet?  Is she crazy?  A roguelike where I have to sit in a cubical and work?  What? Who made this trash?

Hi, I'm yogurtattack.  I m made this trash.  I love ascii art, and wanted to make something where you can die easily, but also live a life out to the fullest. Not a fantasy life, like a real life.  Thus, I came up with wildrogue. 

FAQ:
Question:Why not any oither format?  Pixel Art, 3D art, or anything but ascii?  
Answer: I love ASCII can you not read?  But fair quesiton as well.

Question: Why are you so handsome?  Can we pinch one of those country hams?  
Answer: Idk. No, don't be weird. 

Question:  Do I have to play this in ASCII art?
Answer: No, rot.js allows tiles to be used inplace of ascii characters.  You to find a tile sheet, or make one yourself.  I like ascii, don't ask me. But if you make....
Answer: I'll feature you here, and give you credit, etc.
